## Introduction
I bring over 7 years of experience in Digital Transformation, from reimagining the operations of financial teams at IBM to defining collaboration strategies for newly-divested companies. Currently, I focus on helping clients leverage Slack to save time and reduce costs, with a speciality in migrations and divestitures.

Outside of work, I am an avid traveller already having been to 15+ countries and will continue to add more to the list! I love cooking, especially Italian, and my three kitchen must-haves are:
1. Dutch oven
2. Food processor
3. Spider Strainer

## Education <!--[Return](#table_of_contents)-->
I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (B.S.B.A) in Operations and Supply Chain, formerly known as Global Supply Chain & Operations Management (GSCOM), and a minor in Portuguese.
