## Introduction
I bring over 7 years of experience in Digital Transformation, from re-imagining the operations of financial teams at IBM to defining collaboration strategies for newly-divested companies. Currently, I focus on helping clients leverage Slack to save time and reduce costs, with a specialty in migrations and divestitures.

Outside of work, I am an avid traveler already having been to 15+ countries and will continue to add more to the list! The image in each of my [projects](/projects/) is somewhere I've traveled to and love, and some of those images are mine.

## Experience
### Freelance Consulting (Current)
After leaving Slalom, I took some time off to travel! Once I got back, I started freelancing for Slack projects. As you can see on my [projects page](/projects/), my specialties are:
1. Launching Slack for new organizations
2. Migrating into Enterprise Grid
3. Divesting from Enterprise Grid
4. Merging multiple workspaces into one

### Slalom
I joined Slalom as a Principal Consultant, and my primary responsibilities were supporting our clients with their Slack projects and owning/managing the Slack Enterprise Grid for Slalom. While my role was supposed to be exclusively external-facing, I was able to spend some time helping different teams/departments learn how to leverage Slack to improve their workflows. Some of my favorite projects were:
1. Migrating from Enterprise Grid to Business+, saving Slalom over $250,000 a year
2. Supporting Tableau in their Slack implementation for Tableau Conference 22, resulting in a savings of over 50%
3. Connecting ServiceNow/Service Cloud/Sales Cloud to Slack and creating proof-of-concepts on how these tools can work together
4. Launching Slack for an industry leader in the Security and Automation field

### Kyndryl
IBM sold part of its business to form a new company called Kyndryl. During the divestiture, I owned the first-of-its-kind end-to-end Slack migration from IBM to Kyndryl. This entailed working with all business leaders to determine *what* needed to be migrated, *when*, and more importantly *how*. Once the divestiture was completed, I owned and maintained Slack for the Kyndryl enterprise while serving as the Team Lead for Slack, Jira, Trello, Webex, Watson Media, and Mural. My biggest accomplishments in this role were:
1. Architecting the collaboration strategy across productivity tools suite for the entire organization
2. Being the go-to person for anything CIO related

### IBM
#### Slack@IBM
This was the first time I truly worked with Slack, rather than using it as a tool for work. The Slack@IBM team was responsible for the enablement, support, and growth of Slack across the IBM enterprise of 500,000+ users. After a few weeks of learning the tool, I was promoted to Org Admin and quickly started supporting the team and organization, while becoming the face of Slack@IBM. This role was what started the rest of my Slack journey, and where I learned the most. Some highlights of my time on the team were:
1. Becoming IBM's first Slack Certified Admin (and first 50 worldwide)
2. Reduced workspace count by over 60% and removed 100,000 guests that did not meet IBM's continued business need standard
3. Using Python/Jupyter, identifying the highest risk apps across the Grid
4. Rolling out Workflow Builder for the organization, and promptly breaking it for everyone ðŸ˜Š *I promise I learned from it*

#### Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Being part of the RPA team, I was tasked with assessing potential automation projects, consulting on to-be designs, leveraging technologies, and developing RPA solutions to meet internal stakeholder needs. Overall, this was my first consulting job as I had to work with the team from doing discovery, designing a solution, and finally implementing it. My top three projects while on the team were:
1. Creating critical business object to follow the Federal Denied Parties List guidelines resulting in savings totaling 5,000 hours per year
2. Integrating Salesforce and internal Complaint Management tool to update and link tickets, reducing process time by 30%
3. Leveraging RPA, Python, and Slack to create and end-to-end process reading emails, extracting PDF information, and verifying information against multiple internal databases

#### Center Strategy & Work Transition
IBM has large offices across the world called centers, which are essentially non-corporate offices. This role was focused on developing and assisting cross-center strategies to move work/roles between them to reduce costs, and even supporting the financials of moving people from one country to another. The two biggest highlights of this role were:
1. Leading an organization-wide realignment implementation of over 3,500 people using various HR tools and systems, while leveraging Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to reduce manual input process time by 87%
2. Tracking and maintaining more than $290 million worth of internal budget transfers

## Education
I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (B.S.B.A) in Operations and Supply Chain, formerly known as Global Supply Chain & Operations Management (GSCOM), and a minor in Portuguese.
